## There are two solutions to this 2D array problem.

1. Functional solution which are a few static functions without changing any state.
2. Object Oriented solution which uses a few classes to save the state of the traveresed matrix. This looks like a cleaner code.

There are unit tests that test some of the corner cases that I could think of. The tests are located in "2DMatrix.Test" folder.

The main project compiles as an executable that runs the code with a few sample cases. There's a switch to choose which solution to use. By default it runs the OOO solution.
